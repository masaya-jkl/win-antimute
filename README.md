# win-antimute
Counters speaker muting on Windows.

Born from the need to fix Windows&#8217; System Volume Control problem of randomly or repetitively muting itself.    
The problem could stem from so many things. A faulty driver, a rogue or malicious program... or just a non-critical hardware failure.

But you don&#8217;t have the time nor resources to deal with the root cause of the problem and neither do you want to get another computer just because of this; yet you are still desperate enough. Maybe, this isn&#8217;t your problem at all and you just want to prevent the speakers from muting for some other reason.    
This simple, stupid but effective script counters this problem. It won't fool an audiophile, but at least you&#8217;ll be able to hear things again-- if the speakers and drivers themselves still work.
